# odocs
Odocs is my documentation manual. I am very forgetful, and I think searching online for basic stuff I forgot makes me look incompetent, so I'll just make my own reference.

## How to use?
Look in the `docs` directory for a `.odoc` file. Copy it and edit it to your liking. Then come here and run `python3 bake_all.py`. The new html files will be in the `html_baked` directory!
